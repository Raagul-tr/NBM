Hi, This is my experminent code built in python.
You need pygame and psychopy pacakage installed to run this code.

This eperiment explores how words with different valence (negative, neutral & postitive) impacts the formation of Non-believed memories.
Nonbelieved Memories, are vivid autobiographical memories for events that people no longer believe happened to them (Scoboria et al., 2016).

There are 2 parts in this experiment. sess 1 and sess 2

**sess 1**  presents all the words and gives a distractor task.

**sess 2** - recognition test with recollection & belief ratings --> distractor task --> random false feedback --> post recollection & belief ratings
